\textbf{BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH}\\
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\end{centering}

The author was born before the breaking of the first silence and the music of Creation. He interned with Manwe, but thought he
was a total dork and joined Melkor in his quest to free Arda from Eru's dominion. After the War of Wrath,
he spent some time tricking some morons in Numenor into invading Valinor, and tricked some other
morons in Eregion into forging rings of power.
